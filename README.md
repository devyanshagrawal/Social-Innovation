# Social-Innovation
A social issue (also called a social problem or a social situation) is an issue that relates to society's perception of a person's personal life. Different cultures have different perceptions and what may be "normal" behavior in one society may be a significant social issue in another society. 
Man's duty to "allow the same rights to others as we allow ourselves". The failure to do so causes the birth of a social issue. 

<h1>Phase 1: ENGAGE</h1>
This phase allows the observer to study the uncommon situations in the community and   connection with the society has been established. The phase comprises of the following activities: 
<li>Initial visit/s to the community</li>                   
<li>Observe the current situations & identify problems of the community</li>
<li>Document the observation		</li>
<li>Brain storm</li>

<h1>Phase 2: INSPIRATION</h1>
Creating meaningful solutions begins with gaining a deep understanding of people’s needs.
In the Inspiration phase, we will learn directly from the people and immerse ourselves in their lives and come to deeply understand their needs and aspirations.  The steps involved are:

Step 1: Research Planning 
Step 2: Building Interview Guide
Step 3: Capture Learnings

<h1>Phase 3: Ideation -Synthesis</h1>
The Ideation phase transform research into meaningful and actionable insights that will become the foundation of design. Drawing from everything we observed and heard from the people we have identified key themes and insights that will help to define opportunities for design that are differentiated and generative.
Step 1: Search for Meaning
Step 2: Create “How Might We” Questions

<h2>3.1 Synthesis: Search for Meaning-Turn Learnings into Opportunities for Design</h2>
The Ideation phase begins with synthesis, translate learnings into opportunities. We have streamlined the synthesis piece of Ideation into a few steps. Here’s a glance at how learnings will eventually evolve into ideas that can take forward into the second major part of the Ideation phase prototyping.

<h3>Issue Identified </h3>
Enhancing the capacity of students to apply theoretical knowledge.
<br><br>

<b>Theme 1.:  Application knowledge</b>
Insights:

1. students don’t know the application part of what they are learning.
2. it is very difficult for the children to learn every aspect theoretically without imagination,    visualization and experience.
3. children don’t get the opportunity to enhance and showcase their knowledge as no workshops, programs are held in the school. 

<b>Theme 2.:resources: (non-technical)

Insights:

1.Government schools don’t have a proper topics, syllabus, sources and ideas on which 
experiments have to be performed
2. lack of sources for obtaining information.
3. syllabus is vast.
4.No science labs (due to cost) and no libraries.

<b>Theme3.: Technology:
Insights:

1.  lack of modern method of learning like smart boards and other visual equipment.
2. the method of teaching must be changed, no technology to stay up-to-date with the schools all around.

Theme 4.: student faculty interaction:

Insights:

1.no one – one interaction between students and teacher.
2.teachers do not know and thus do not spread the importance of practicals
3.slow learners are ignored.

  <h1>Phase 4: Implementation</h1>  
As a part of implementation, 

<li>We decided to conduct a workshop for the students of class 7 and 8 on two days 28-11-2019 and 29-11-2019</li>
<li>On the first day we spoke to the principal, teacher and we did a small interaction session.  </li>
<li>We performed a few experiments, conducted an interaction session and taught them a few helpful Vedic math tricks.</li>

The experiments that we conducted were:
1.litmus paper experiment.
2.oxygen is needed for combustion.
3.Anatomy of human body
4.Gravitational force 
5. Vedic maths tricks
6.parts of a flower.
7. A question and answer session.
8. Newton's law
9. interaction session.
